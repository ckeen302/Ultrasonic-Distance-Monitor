Ultrasonic Distance Monitoring System
This project utilizes a Raspberry Pi, an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04), and Flask to create a real-time distance monitoring system. The system measures distances, logs data, and visualizes trends through a dynamic web interface with live updates and LED indicators.

Features
Real-Time Distance Monitoring: Continuously measures distances using the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor.
Dynamic LED Control: LEDs indicate the distance range based on customizable thresholds.
Web Interface: Built using Flask to display real-time distance data.
Live Graphs: Visualize distance trends dynamically with Chart.js.
Adjustable Thresholds: Set and update thresholds via the web interface.
Data Logging: Logs all distance readings into a CSV file for analysis.
Technologies Used
Python: Backend logic and GPIO control.
Flask: Web framework for serving the interface and API.
Chart.js: Frontend library for real-time graphing.
HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Web interface components.
RPi.GPIO: GPIO control for Raspberry Pi.
Hardware Requirements
Raspberry Pi (any model with GPIO support).
HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor.
LEDs (3) with 220Ω resistors.
Breadboard and Jumper Wires.
Setup Instructions
1. Hardware Setup
Connect the HC-SR04 sensor:
VCC → Raspberry Pi 5V.
GND → Raspberry Pi GND.
TRIG → GPIO 14.
ECHO → GPIO 15 (use a voltage divider if needed).
Connect LEDs:
Anodes to GPIO 16, 17, and 18.
Cathodes to GND via 220Ω resistors.
2. Software Setup
Clone this repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ultrasonic-distance-monitor.git
cd ultrasonic-distance-monitor
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the project:
bash
Copy code
sudo python3 ultrasonic_led_web.py
3. Access the Web Interface
Find your Raspberry Pi’s IP address:
bash
Copy code
hostname -I
Open a browser and navigate to:
